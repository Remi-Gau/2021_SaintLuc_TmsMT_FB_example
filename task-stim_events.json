    "Description": "Duration of the event (measured from onset) in seconds.\nMust always be either zero or positive (or `n/a` if unavailable).\nA \"duration\" value of zero implies that the delta function or event is so\nshort as to be effectively modeled as an impulse.\n",

    "StimulationIntensityProcedure": "The stimulation intensity was matched to the one used in a previous study, which applied cTBS to hMT+/V5 and successfully affected visual motion performance (Cai et al., 2014). The AMT for each hemisphere was determined at the start of each TMS session to account for interhemispheric differences and daily fluctuations. It was defined as the lowest stimulation intensity at which a single TMS pulse over the subjectsâ€™ motor hot spot evoked a small visible response in the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in 5 out of 10 consecutive trials when the subject activated the FDI muscles. In the given subject pool the AMT lay at an average intensity of 42% (SD = 6%, range = [32% 58%]) of the maximum stimulator output (MSO). The order in which the hemispheres were stimulated was counterbalanced across subjects."
